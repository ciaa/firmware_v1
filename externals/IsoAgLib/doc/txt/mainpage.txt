 - Enhancement: Limit scheduler via #define
   #define ISOAGLIB_SCHEDULER_MAX_TIMEEVENT XX
   #define ISOAGLIB_TASK_MAX_TIMEEVENT XX
   #define ISOAGLIB_DEBUG_TIMEEVENT

iLibErr_c:
 - Bugfix: Some Callbacks were not being called

Trac-classes:
 - Enhancement: 
   - TimePosGps: Added sending in USE_J1939_VEHICLE_PGNS case
   - TracMove: Added specific timestamps/timeouts-detection to WBS/GBS/MSS
 - Workaroundfix: Close/ReInit had a problem with filters
   Small workaround fix to get filters recreated.
   No further change as TracClasses are subject for redesign anyway.

Logalizer:
 - Added CSV log type
 - Added WTK log type support and MAINTAIN_POWER_REQUEST_PGN
 - Added Kvaser Memorator CSV log format
 - Added gpx-writing

conf2build:
 - Changed working, but invalid condition

HAL:
 - EEPROM: Fixed wrong assertions in write/eofp/eofg
 - Bugfix HAL-Simulator: Range checks in I/O files

Diagnostics:
 - Enhancement: Added getter into internal interface

IsoMonitor/IdentItem:
 - Enhancement
   - Define SA_REQUEST_PERIOD_MSEC to 0 to disable period SA requests when CONFIG_ISO_ITEM_MAX_AGE > 0
   - Callback reactOnWsAnnounceFinished() added to ControlFunctionStateHandler_c
   - Added proper getter getIsoBusInstance()
     - old one was getMultitonInst(), which is still
       there for backward-compatibility.
     - This one just adds an assertion!

vt2iso:
 - Bugfix
   - Escape quotes correctly in input attributes validation string
   - Crash if language used that's not specified fixed

TC-Client:
 - Bugfix: Properly (re)start measurement on TC changes
 - Change: Refactor connect/disconnect
 - Enhancement
   - Stop sending measurement when TC is lost; trigger eventTaskStopped if task was active
   - Add propertyDefaultSet()-getter
   - Add possibility to manually manage PD messages for proprietary manner
   - Warning: only use if you know what you are doing
     - implement and register iPdMessageHandler_c for receiving PD messages
     - use iTcClient_c::sendPdMessage for sending PD messages
 - Workaround: Added temporary #ifdef'd Workaround for Mueller-TC
   Should not be used and by fixed by Mueller.
   This needs to be defined to enable it
   This will be removed in future from ISOAgLib.

VT-Client: (ATTENTION!)
 - Bugfix: Button-Content Scaling fixed as in vt-designer v1.6
   New corrected button-content scaling is active by default.
   Use USE_VT_CLIENT_OLD_INCORRECT_BUTTON_CONTENT_SCALING if your
   objectpool is not yet adapted and you want the old incorrect scaling.
 - Enhancement
   - Response-Timeout-Detection added:
     This way the cause of a reconnect can be displayed to the operator
   - Temporary solution to work around missing responses from the VT.
     - ENABLE_VTCLIENT_RETRY:
       Will perform 2 retries when no response is being received
       ATTENTION: This leads to undefined behavior for "relative"
                  commands like Change Child Location!!!
     - CONFIG_VT_CLIENT_ON_MISSING_RESPONSE_CONTINUE
       Finally, when the response is (even after possible retries) missing,
       continue (after having called eventAllRetriesFailedNowContinuing())
       with the next command instead of completely disconnecting and reconnecting!
   - UTF-16 support added (VTv4+ only!) and removing spaces on Change String Value
     Both per defines USE_VT_UNICODE_SUPPORT
     and STRIP_TRAILING_SPACES_FROM_STRING_UPLOADS
 - VT-Workaround: Some VTs send responses to TP commands before the EoMAck
   - Such responses are now buffered.
   - Use WORKAROUND_PREMATURE_TP_RESPONSES to enable this
     (until those broken VTs get a firmware update in Nov 2014!)
   - This should not be enabled forever in production software, the VTs need to be fixed/updated!
   
MultiPacket:
 - Enhancement
   - Support interpreting new CTS-Limit requested in RTS
   - Added ENABLE_MULTIPACKET_RETRY
     Will now retry max. 2 times in a burst.
     It will wait until the last packet until it re-CTSes.

 - Bugfix: CAN-Server-Msq-Client: Correctly initialize startUpTime.
 - NOTE: The CanFifo is now always used. This is not unlimited as was the CAN-Server's system pipe, so be sure to definitely not delay ISOAgLib's (CAN-)processing!
 - Enable the HALs to be able to configure the filters to hardware (Full-CAN, e.g. CAN-Server, SocketCAN)
 - Reintroduced IsoFilterManager to be able to used filtering of the HAL (e.g. CAN-Server) to keep cpu-load down. Needs to be enable per HAL itself using HAL_USE_SPECIFIC_FILTERS

\subsection Change_W 2.5.1 to 2.5.2

CAN-HAL/Processing
- Redesign:
  - Unified the CAN-HAL: Removed SYSTEM_WITH_ENHANCED_CAN_HAL. Now there's only one simple HAL.
  - Incoming packets are simply enqueued, no hardware filtering used.
  - No more need for dynamic reconfiguration of hardware-filters, hence no more runtime-blocks (for worst case several hundreds milliseconds) during reconfiguration.
  - Watchdog-triggering can now finally be done completely in the application. ISOAgLib's System does not care for the watchdog anymore!
  - Removed the watchdog-trigger-task.
  - CAN HAL always needs to work properly, no more Fatal Errors registered in iLibErr_c.

(Extended) Transport Protocol:
- Sending timing improved and is now actually faster.

IsoMonitor:
- Optimization: Fast lookup for CAN-reception in CanPkgExt_c-constructor via IsoItem_c* array.

Proprietary bus:
- Bugfix: iCanPkg_c::set now handles data bytes correctly

Proprietary PGN:
- Rewritten due to change in CAN-processing.

Error Management:
- Cleanup:
  - Finally (currently) no more Fatal Errors (from setup/init/close/etc.), will all be handled via assertions!
  - Only Non-Fatal Errors (occuring during runtime) will be registered for applications information.
  
Tools:
- Removed deprecated old "Makefile"s as everything is to be compiled via CMake/make now.


\subsection Change_V 2.5.0 to 2.5.1

Scheduler/CAN-HAL:
- Restructuring: 
  - Simplified Scheduler. All runnings tasks must be run-to-completion and short, hence no more getForcedMinExecTimeDefault().
  - Extended can_waitUntilCanReceiveOrTimeout() to take a 32bit value as paramter instead of 16bit.
  - Introducing iWatchdogTriggerTask_c and removed many of the internal triggerWd-calls (except for filter-reconfiguration)
  - CanIo_c's processMsg got a new parameter: processMsg( bool& stopCanProcessing ).
  - Removed updateEarlierAndLatestInterval()-calls, also getTaskName().
  - Removed return-type from timeEvent()-call.
  - Allow task-triggering based on fixed or flexible timestamps.
  - Renamed registering/deregistering.
  - Introduced OneShot-Timer and a register-delay.
  
proc2iso:
- Cleanup: "counter" changed to "total".

VT-Client:
- Making more robust if other VTs would send to us, which is a theoretical case only.

TC-Client:
- Compatibility: Improved by sending correct IS reserved fields.

IsoMonitor:
- Cleanup: Removed obsolete functions.

(Extended) Transport Protocol:
- Receiving-speed now up to speed again when multiple (E)TPs are being received and kept for later processing (was only the case in VT-/TC-/FS-Servers).

conf2build.sh:
- Enhancement: Supply CMake template as parameter.


\subsection Change_U 2.4.0 to 2.5.0

General:
- Compilefixes:
  - Visual Studio 10
  - Qt pathlength: Shortened file names to get it compile with Qt
  - IAR: Bitfieldwrapped fixed to work with IAR now.
- Cleanup:
  - Removed all (known) warnings on all platforms once again.
  - Removed default parameters, replaced many checks overall with proper isoaglib_assert(..) calls.
  - Removed EXTERNAL_DEBUG_DEVICE - ISOAgLib doesn't tell you anymore how to debug your application, also the name was confusing. Only INTERNAL_DEBUG_DEVICE left for use within the library!
  - Removed USE_FLOAT_DATA_TYPE - float-code is now always enabled
  - Removed executable flag from source files
  - Several defines cleaned up (removed DEBUG_TIME_EVENTS, DEBUG_HEAP_USEAGE) and debug-code removed
  - Removed IStateExt_c
  - Removed NO_CAN_EN_CHECK / CONFIG_BUFFER_SHORT_CAN_EN_LOSS_MSEC: This functionaliy can easily be implemented in the application. Removed to avoid confusion due to defines declared in isoaglib_config.h
  - Replaced CanIo_c::init's default paramter 13 with (CONFIG_CAN_OBJ_CNT-1)
  - Removed YES/NO and _YN defines
  - Fixed HANDLE_FAST_DATATYPE_AS_STRICT

  - Renamed TIMEOUT_TRACTOR_DATA to CONFIG_TIMEOUT_TRACTOR_DATA.
  - Renamed OBJECT_CONFIG to DEBUG_CONFIG.
  - Replaced TRUE/FALSE to true/false, except for WinApi calls.
- Restructuring:
  - Use isoaglib_config.h for accessing hal header now - this is the only file you need to include (to get the typedefs, etc.)

Singleton:
- Fix: Corrected Alignment (now second, thire, etc. instances are properly aligned) and init-bool (Pointer-Array of instances wasn't initialized with 0; now done with a single static bool)
- Cleanup:
  - Multitons now ALWAYS have an instance member, even if only
    one instance is created, hence being a "singleton"-kind...
  - Classes like System_c and EepromIo_c are now explicit "Singletons",
    they use their own macro for creation and do not store any "instance" member variable at all.

iLibErr_c:
- Redesigned error handling. Most errors are now handled via assertions. Only few runtime-errors left.
- Added non fatal faults on SA and NAME conflicts

Diagnostics:
- Bugfix: Didn't answer dest-spec. requests to ECU_ID/SW_ID anymore.

System_c:
- Cleanup:
  - Removed error check during system init (all platforms). Init must succeed.
  - Change getOnOffSwitch's return type to bool
  - PowerHold settings on init and close: When the system is initialized then the self holding power function is requested from the HAL. On shutdown it gets turned off to allow the controller to shut down.
  - canEn() is deprecated and replaced by switchedOn.
- Enhancement:
  - System init/shutdown: User application has to call system init and close. This is not down anymore by Scheduler_c::init. Furthermore the shutdown strategy is implemented by the different HALs.

HALs:
- Bugfix:
  - PC: getAdc fixed: Now checking for ANALOG_INPUT_MAX instead of DIGITAL_INPUT_MAX.
  - STW-HALs: Rx path fix - copy data immediately at beginning of IRQ handler to secure it against overwriting
- Cleanup:
  - Removed T_TASK_BASIC, should be needed only for STW platform an set in BIOS headers.
  - Removed GET_U_THRESHOLD from all HALs. Is defined for ESX and should only be used in ESX HAL.
  - Removed getLokalId from Dj1 and ESX Micro HAL.
  - Replaced CONFIG_EEPROM_PADDING_BYTE with hardcoded 0xFF. Shouldn't be used/received anyhow!
  - C2C: MAX_ADC_V changed to CONFIG_HAL_C2C_MAX_ADC_V
  - ESX: CALC_PERDIOD_FROM_FREQ changed to CONFIG_HAL_ESX_CALC_PERDIOD_FROM_FREQ
  - PC: WRITE_LOG_FILE -> CONFIG_HAL_PC_RS232_WRITE_LOG_FILE
  - PC: HAL_PC_RTE_DEFAULT_SERVER changed to CONFIG_HAL_PC_RTE_DEFAULT_SERVER
  - CAN fifo access cleaned up.
  - STW ESX specific functions and interface definitions removed. (startTaskTimer and init_task_call are specific for STW controllers and should not be decleared in IsoAgLibs HAL interface.)
  - ESX: Fixed double watchdog init
  - Obsolete HAL return types that are unused within IsoAgLib removed. (iSystem_c::init, iSystem_c::close, HAL::openSystem, HAL::closeSystem)
  - Renamed HAL::open_system to openSystem
  - Replaced EE_READY with HAL_NO_ERR in HAL inteface (EEPROM)
  - PC:
    - No more endianess/float-word-order defaults for obsolete platforms.
    - Needs to be specified explicitly and config.h will bail out if not set.
    - Shutting system down restructuted.

(E)TP:
- Improvement:
  - Proper timing for CTS sending/timeout detection, send CTS right away. Speeds up multi-packet reception.
  - Made it possible to start new (E)TP from Success/Abort-callback

Network-Management:
- Cleanup:
  - Renamed saclaimhandler_c.h -> cfstatehandler_c.h and removed SaClaimHandler_c typedef.
  - IsoItemModification_t replaced with iIsoItemAction_e

- Enhancement: Added USE_EEPROM_DRIVER to be used by the configuration files.

TC-Client:
- Fix: Now properly checking invalid/uninteresting SA/DA.
- Optimization: Usage of IdentItem in part 7 for address claim state checks
- Cleanup:
  - Do not check for local member before adding filter: There's no need for a local iso member for track move to add the PG filters.
  - Removed "optimized" code in TracLight
  - Renamed Process_c -> TcClient.
  - Removed all obsolete code regarding the "old" process data. Only left what's needed for communication with a TC/DataLogger, etc.

  - Replaced old not maintained makefile with cleaned up one.
  - Removed ProcessDataCombination.
- Output files changed:
  - Created an initProcData() function optionally sets the handler on all ProcData-instances.

VT-Client:
- Certification:
  - Reversed GET_VERSIONS to NO_GET_VERSIONS, so retrieving the versions from the VT is default now (as needed for certification!)
- Enhancement:
  - Added v4 features in iVtObjectButton_c (v4select, v4setOptions, v4enable, v4disable)
  - Added Delete Version command sendNonVolatileDeleteVersion(..);
  - Added possibility to omit objects from upload. Caution: Use at your own risk.

- Enhancement:
  - Counter extended to 32 bit.
- Cleanup:
  - Removed all "virtual" from the I/O classes, except the destructor.
  - Removed valLong().

TC-Server:
- Bugfix: The bits 7-3 of byte 7 ground based speed and distance are reserved and hence now set to 1.
          Note: This is not done for the other PGNs yet.

GPS:
- Cleanup: Assertion in tractor mode: An ident must be given as argument.

HAL-Simulator:
- Enhancement: Added "GetEEPROM_FileName()" and added hal_simulator EEPROM Target Extension.

CAN-Server:
- Filtering: Bugfix: Fixed input format for DA
- Restructuring: Separated can_server.h out of ISOAgLib-usage: can_server.h only needs
  PC-HAL now, no more isoaglib_config.h or other ISOAgLib sources.

CAN:
- Bugfix: Fixed endless loop in processMsg() which occured at system shutdown when
  a message with a higher msgobj-number is in the queue and then filters got remove in between.
- Corrected functions to get bus-load. (Note: This is only the sending load!)

Util:
- Separated Flexible8ByteString_c/Flexible4ByteString_c into dedicated file.


\subsection Change_T 2.3.0 to 2.4.0

Diagnostics Services / Certification issues:
- Fix: According to Part 3, the diagnostic messages are now broadcast if requested via broadcast, else they are responded directly.
- Enhancement: Added support of AEF functionality message. Please note that this is currently an AEF specification, which is reflected in the API. As soon as this will be official ISO-standard, it'll be renamed.
- Fix: (Change/Clarification): Send DM1 only if at least one DTC active. Also fixed the timing.
- SW-Identification now with correct '*' at the end (only one)
- Transport Protocol: Timeouts set down to values from the standard for certification reasons.

Tractor-Client:
- Bugfix: Querying the KeySwitch works again. (backported to 2.3.0 and 2.2.1 also)

General:
- API-Cleanup: Removed some obsolete APIs like CANCustomer-typedef, IsoName with DIN-like constructors (devClass, devClassInst=0), etc.
- Compiler-Cleanup: Many warnings removed for several platforms.

System:
- Renamed canEn() -> switchedOn(), because CAN-Enable is a DIN name. Kept canEn() as deprecated for backwards-compatibility until the next release
 
Network-Management:
- Bugfix: Proper address-verification added in all modules using processMsg/processMsgRequestPGN, don't NACK if unanswered PGN requested from NULL address.
- Fix: Address-Claiming now properly tries addresses in the range of 0x80..0xEE cyclically from the start-address.
- Enhancement: More exact timing while in the 250ms AdressClaim phase
- Redesign: IsoName_c's "unspecified" is now an additional boolean, so NAMEs with all bits set (8 times FF) arenow valid ISO-nodes.

VT-Client:
- Fix: Getting Font-Properties from the VT now filters out the reserved bits (only valid for non-certified-VTs that send the reserved bit as 1).
- Enhancement: First support for Multiple VTs: Application can store the "preferred VT" now via callback.
- Enhancement: First Aux Type2 implementations added for testing - be aware that this is not implemented by 100% right now.
- Enhancement: Query stored Versions before trying to load via Load Version. This needs to be enabled with "GET_VERSIONS" if desired.
- Enhancement: Added getVtColorDepth() to iVtServerInstance_c.

CAN-Server:
- Enhancement: Added interactive filtering

Build-system:
- Fix: Proprietary PGN define was not generated, hence PropPGN-Module didn't work although enabled.
- Cleanup: Removed PRJ_MULTIPACKET, as support for TP/ETP is now always included, regardless of any setting.
- Enhancement: Improved conf2build's VisualC++ Makefile generation (via CMake). Will now split ISOAgLib/App files into groups.

FS-Client:
- Cleanup: Made the methods of iFsClient_c abstract.
- API-Change: Now passing Whitelist per value instead of pointer in the std::vector, and the vector itself per const reference.

TC-Client:
- Fix for VRT: Don't send any PROCESS_DATA with SETPOINT_ERROR_COMMAND.

Logalizer:
- Enhancement: Added parser for SocketCAN tool 'candump'.

PC-HAL:
- Enhancement: Added setup-hook for ISOAgLib-Thread (for setting of priority, etc.)

Multipacket (TP/ETP):
- Fix: Don't accept ETP with <1786 bytes anymore.
  NOTE: This may cause issues with non-conformant/-certified implements that were using ETP instead of TP.
- Enhancement: Buffer is now reserved with the correct size, so really no reallocation takes place as it was intended to be.


\subsection Change_S 2.2.1 to 2.3.0

CAN:
- Enhancement: Added initial support for SocketCAN under Linux: Enable by using "sys" for "x86linux"
- Bugfix: Not processing uninitialized CAN-busses anymore. (Avoid crashing)
- Bugfix: If send-queue of CAN-device is full a certain amount of time (defaulting currently to 10 ms) is waited, if queue is still full, CAN-device-queue is cleared and new message inserted.
- Bugfix: On removing filters check for empty filterbox-array was missing (only theoretical problem)
- Bugfix: CanPkg_c::operator!= fixed. (Wasn't used in last release anyway)
- Bugfix: No more busy waiting if send buffer full. (Introduced new HAL-function)
- Bugfix: CAN-processing could crash in rare cases (canMsgToFilterBox was matching/processing idle Filterboxes)
- Bugfix: Avoid possible crash by setting the FilterBox's BusNr directly at CanIo_c::insertFilter(..)
- Bugfix: Properly shielding Init/Close now, close didn't close. (Maybe in previous versions it did)
- Cleanup: Mask/Filter: Encapsulation of CAN mask/filter combinations
  - Removed DEFAULT_IDENT_TYPE, CanIo_c loses the IdentType
  - Removed Ident_c::empty() / setEmpty() functionality. Use iMaskFilter_c instead.
  - Removed 16bit filter functions. (Optimization not needed)
  - CanPkgExt_c: removed explicit can frame type argument
  - Introduced new file imaskfilter_c.h: iMaskFilter_c, iMaskFilterType_c

  - Removed getData()/data() declaration of CanCustomer
    Added filter and ability to receive Std CAN frames on IsoBus instance

vt2iso:
- Enhancement: Include vtl files that match <languagecode>.*.vtl:
  In order to split translation into seperate vtl files, vt2iso scans all dictionary directories for <languagecode>.*.vtl files, that will be parsed.
- Enhancement: Added pedantic mode for translation value resolving:
  Added -k option to vt2iso that makes vt2iso abort when a translateable value is marked language specific in the xml, but no value is found for every associated language in the .vtl/.values* files.
- Fix: Version-Checks added: Now checking the OP Version for different elements/attributes, e.g. if OutputLists are being used in a v2 pool, etc.
- Fix: Conversion:
  - Allowing all characters now in Strings - they will be escaped now.
  - <stringvariable> now also properly escapes special characters just as the <output/inputstring> does.]

update_makefile.sh/conf2build:
- IMPORTANT: Renamed "update_makefile.sh" to "conf2build.sh", which expresses more what this tool is about.
- Enhancement: The CMakeLists.txt is extended by an additional target that creates tag files for cscope and ctags.
- Enhancement: Generally improved the CMakeLists.txt output for Windows / Linux.
- Bugfix: With external HALs: Now not collecting .cpp-files twice anymore.
- Cleanup: Removed obsolete VC6 creation. (Use CMake instead!)
- Cleanup: Removed kdevelop3 and Doxygen creation.

Tractor/GPS:
- Enhancement: Added rough support for J1939 PGSs: Enable this feature with "USE_J1939_VEHICLE_PGNS". It's not on by default, because there may be a problem when both speeds are on the bus.
- Bugfix TracMove:
  - Set selected Isoname on move msg reception, was ignored before somehow.
  - Fix selected distance direction usage for wheel based PGN.
- Bugfix: Don't regard Sender with N/A Selected Speed Source at all, just discard msg. (Before a SenderConflict was registered in iLibErr.)
 
Logalizer:
- Enhancement: Added support for PCANExplorer log-files.
- Enhancement: Extended with the Vehicle PGNs.
- Enhancement: Updated JRF format-parsing to new (hex) format.
- Enhancement: Now supporting Multiple (extended) transport protocol sessions.
- Enhancement: (E)TP-Sessions output as single frames and also as complete chunk of data.

- Enhancement: Tracking addresses now.
- Bugfix: Logalizer now recognizes RTE log which starts with REQUEST_MSG.

General:
- Enhancement: iLibErr_c interface enhanced with error observer.
- Refactoring: CAN-/Singleton-API: 
  - Introduced IsoBus_c/ProprietaryBus_c, cleaned up singleton mechanismn (removed "singletonInit")
  - IdentItem needs to be (de-)registered at IsoMonitor now explicitly.
  - Properly cleaned up init/close methods accordingly
  - BaseCommon_c-classed get "init_specialized" for clarification
  - Removed implicit System_c::init calls from differenct modules, application needs to properly init all modules (System, IsoBus, IdentItem, etc.) explicitly in the correct order now.
  - Added USE_INPUTS / USE_OUTPUTS / USE_FILESERVER_CLIENT defines
  - Singleton framework changed to work properly with all compilers (Singletons/multitons no longer rely on template classes.). No more unused scheduler instances.
  - Separated Container out of singletons.
- Unicode: Now using ISOAGLIB_USE_UNICODE instead of UNICODE/_UNICODE.
- Removed all warnings, even the Visual Studio deprecated ones...
- Cleanup: Actor/Sensor: Changed names from (incorrectly named) Actor and Sensor to Inputs and Outputs.
- Cleanup: Subsystem-Init/Close: Now wrong init/close sequences assert instead of ignoring.

proc2iso:
- Cleanup: proc2iso now generates an iIsoName instead of an iIdentItem

Network Management:
- Bugfix: IsoRequestPgn - Request to Global wasn't registered as init() wasn't called!
- Bugfix: IsoMonitor Destruction: ~IsoItem doesn't do any functionality anymore.
- Bugfix/Interface: The storage of a successfully claimed SA is fixed and now handled by an instance of a iIdentDataStorage_c implementation.
- Cleanup: Interface: An iIdentitem is no longer initialized via constructor. Parameters can be passed only with the init call. Furthermore the parameters are grouped by the usage of iIsoname_c.
- Cleanup: Diagnostics-Handler: Replaced std::string with c-string
- Cleanup: Address-Claiming: Send Req4AdrCl with 0xFE as SA always now, even if one IdentItem has already claimed an address.
- Cleanup: Removed obsolete DiagnosticsMode "mc_serviceTool"

RS232:
- Cleanup: Interface now always has the channel-number so simplicity.
- Cleanup: Removed std::string and std::deque from RS232-Interface.

Transport Protocol:
- Enhancement: Added interface for aborting a stream.
- Enhancement: Improvement MultiSend callback system (create base class MultiSendEventHandler for callback). Replace &SendSuccess with pointer to handler.
- Bugfix: Fixed sending of ConnAbort for wrong sequence (on receive).
- Bugfix: FP-Reception - Now FastPacket is processed properly again, messages were discarded before!
- Cleanup: Removed sendIsoBroadcastOrSinglePacket

EEPROM:
- Refactoring: Moved from "IsoAgLib" mandatory modules to "supplementary_driver" - It's not mandatory anymore as the SA for the iIdentItems will be stored by the application now instead of ISOAgLib in the EEPROM.
- Cleanup: Removed support for STW's ESX EEPROM Editor (via CAN & RS232)
- Cleanup: Removed unnecessary RS232-include
  
ISOAgLibThread:
- Bugfix: Made IsoAgLibThread thread-safety
  - Ran into race-conditions (of course) when used from multiple threads as it was not designed for multiple threads in the first place (intentionally).
  - Now it mutexes itself, so it can be run from different threads

CAN-Server:
- Enhancement: Allow interactive message sending.
- Enhancement: You can start CAN-Server now before or after the ECUs. (Proper messages will be displayed)
- Enhancement: Added return-value for Scheduler_c::init() to properly detect if e.g. CAN-Server is started as root and can't be connected to.
- Bugfix: Potential crash on client-disconnection fixed
- Bugfix SocketCAN: closeBusOnCard - only close if previously opened and set/reset mb_deviceConnected flag

Diagnostics Services:
- Enhancement: Added support for DM1/DM2/DM3 messages (interface added to iIdentItem_c)

Scheduler:
- Bugfix: Now limiting Scheduler-Sleep to 50ms for proper WD-triggering.
  - If no CAN-Packets were on the bus and/or ISO wasn't enabled, the Scheduler could command a long sleep that may have triggered the watchdog.
  - Short term solution: We're now limiting the Scheduler-sleep to 50ms.
- Bugfix: Properly shielding Init/Close now, close didn't close. (Maybe in previous versions it did)

Process-Data / TC-Client:
- Cleanup:
  - Remove ProcDataRemote and rename option PRJ_PROCESS to PRJ_ISO_TASKCONTROLLER_CLIENT.
  - Moved all files to Part10-directory.
  - Not checking for USE_ISO_TASKCONTROLLER_CLIENT anymore, if Process_c is included, it always uses the DeviceDescription handler now.
- Cleanup: Made TC-Client handler functions abstract because of the DDI-parameter addition, so you have to implement all of the handler functions.

VT-Client:
- Enhancement: Added feature to suppress sending of Commands to the VT (actually putting it into the queue), so the changes can be done locally and sent to the VT via Partial Objectpool Update.
- Enhancement: Added "isClientActive()"-Function to iVtClientServerCommunication.
- Bugfix: Fixed crash when a client is re-initialized completely during runtime (by API). Now the vtObject's init is protected to not double init itself with the attributes pointer.
- Cleanup: Added const to char* for versionLabel in initAndRegisterIsoObjectpool()

HAL:
- Enhancement: Counter-Frequency changed from uint16 -> uint32.
- Enhancement: Incorporated HAL-Simulator into PC-System-HAL.
   - Also adapted conf2build.
   - Added USE_OUTPUTS_DRIVER and USE_INPUTS_DRIVER for proper selection of the associated HAL.
   - Renamed some target extension files so the scheme is the same everywhere now.
   - CAN-Server-Socket-HAL-Simulator is now including the Socket-HAL directly to avoid code duplication.
- Enhancement: Extended HAL-Simulator by some more functions.
- Enhancement: Speed up waitUntilCanReceiveOrTimeout in the ESX, ESXµ and C2C HALs. For those embedded platforms a busy-loop-checking for received CAN-messages will be performed, because it's the lowest priority Task and even a delay_us() on the STW hardware will perform a busy-wait.
- Bugfix: PC-System-HAL: On Linux >= 2.6.0 if the application is started with clock_gettime being negative, the startup was always re-generated.
- Cleanup: System-HAL's wdReset() now has "void" return type. Wasn't consistent.
- Cleanup: Proper HAL-interfaces created now. (HAL functions declared in hal_<module>.h now) HAL-implementations can't have a different signature now (as it should be)!
- Cleanup: Moved implicit handling of main-relais from System-module to Outputs_c, where it belongs. It has to be switched on/off explicitly now by the application, ISOAgLib is not touching it anymore.
- Cleanup: Watchdog is now disabled by defeault in all HALs. If the application needs the watchdog enabled, it needs to properly define the watchdog-time and enable it.
- Cleanup: HALs for C2C and ESXµ are unified now.

Inputs: (former Sensor)
- Enhancement: Promoted enums to API, add channelNr() to public API
- Cleanup: CounterI: Value made unsigned to increase range - and HAL getter was already unsigned anyhow!

Outputs: (former Actor)
- Cleanup: Outputs_c is not managing DigitalO_c-instances anymore
- Cleanup: DigitalO_c now has a default-c'tor for array-initialization

ProprietaryPGN:
- Enhancement: Passing sender to process()-function now so application can respond destination specific even if the incoming message was broadcast.


\subsection Change_R 2.2.0 to 2.2.1

General Enhancement/Changes/Cleanups:
- Introduced an internal AutoBuildSystem which builds various application(variant)s to ensure correct compilation/linking on all Tutorial ECUs.
- Change in philosophy: Calls to functions with invalid value (like NULL pointer where not allowed) won't be caught during runtime anymore, behavior is undefined!
  - Enable debugging, then you will get ISOAgLib's assertions during runtime.
  - This is the same behavior as for example the standard-library - a memcpy with NULL pointer(s) will also crash.
- Internally no longer check size after push_front, push_back, because push-operations will crash when out-of-memory anyway.
- Shortened/Unified commentary blocks at the beginning of each file.
- Replaced slist by list for simplicity, because slist is not STL-standard.
- Some left-over system-dependent code moved out of generic ISOAgLib files into the HALs/Compiler-Adaptation.
- General directory structure cleanup.
- Removed obsolete file "eeprom_adr.h".
- Last DIN comments cleaned up ;-)
- DEFINEs:
 - Now "#if" is preferred instead of "#ifdef".
 - SYSTEM_PC_VC: Replaced SYSTEM_PC_VC with _MSC_VER.
 - PC_OS_Linux / PC_OS_Win32: Removed those defines. Were used only in seldom places anyway. Replaced by WIN32 logic, because those defines were built on _WIN32.
 - Moved HAL_PC_RTE_DEFAULT_SERVER to hal/pc/config.h
 - Not undefining USE_EEPROM_IO in case a HAL doesn't provide EEPROM. PRJ_EEPROM needs to be disabled in the config file instead.
 - Removed #ifdef SYSTEM_MITRON167 regarding CNAMESPACE from "can/impl/ident_c.h". Should better be in compiler_adaptation anyway.
 - Removed #ifndef SYSTEM_PM167 regarding missing getBatteryVoltage/getExternalSensorPowerVoltagefrom "driver/system/impl/system_c.h".
 - DEBUG is globally replaced by several more specific defines DEBUG_<module> - so DEBUG can be used for the application now without disturbing ISOAgLib Debug output.
- Inheritance hierarchy is simplified with regard to cancustomer, scheduler, isorequesthandler, saclaimhandler.
- Shutdown stabilized (scheduler, receive-filters for MultiReceive), should not crash anymore.
- API enhanced by control function state change handler (formerly internal SA claim handler)
- TP/ETP: Filtering now considers sender-node.
- Stabilized for multiple clients, multiple servers and when the server is offline.
- Dealing properly with multiple ISOBUS instances.
- Class IsoAgLibThread_c introduced.
- Flexible4ByteString_c fixed particularly with regard to comparisions.
- Assertions preferred to error signaling in util functions. If program behaves strange, simply disable "NDEBUG" to enable assertions.

VT-Client:
- Change: Default color conversion done by brightness rather than by type now.
- Change: Switched from 2 command-retries after 1.5s to no retry and completely reconnecting after 10s without command-response.
- Bugfix: enterSafeState was not called when no messages were read anymore at all. This is fixed now.
- Bugfix: Appropriate reconnection after NACK.
- Bugfix: Sending CAN-packets from the event-handlers will no longer disturb the further internal processing.
- Added access for the iVtServerInstance_c in the VT-Client Interface.
- Added method "bool connectedToVtServer()" in (i)VtClientServerCommunication_c to check if a connection to a VT-Server is established.
- Allow Application to add additional IOP-data to the Objectpool(-Upload) for optimizing special cases.
- Structural cleanup of Upload-Sequence.
- Don't upload SKMs with too much SKs (regarding the VT's #virtualSKs)
  - SKM-objects with more SKs than the amount of VT's supported virtual SKs are not uploaded to the VT.
  - The application needs to ensure that a >6 SK SKM is not initially connected to a datamask, because this would lead to a dangling reference during upload and a pool-rejection.
  - To be correct, construct the objectpool as following:
    Only connect <= 6 SK SKMs in Data-/Alarm-Masks. Only put additional >6 SK SKMs loose into the objectpool and change the associated SKM in the DM/AM during runtime.
- Added "getSkPhysical()" and "getSkVirtual()" to "iVtServerInstance_c".
- Added BUTTON_HAS_BEEN_RELEASED define, which was strangely missing.
- Language-PGN processed only once now, it was called twice before although only being on the bus once.
- Added missing features for operating the VT-Client as Slave.
- Deal with InputList's attributes, even if they vary from v2 to v4.
- Include paths <IsoAgLib/····> preferred to "../../····" to avoid too long paths in case ISOAgLib is placed deep in the filesystem.

vt2iso:
- Bugfix: Properly outputs the objects' initialization.
- Writing out proper external declaration using namespaces. (Only had an effect when using namespaces).
- Gives informative output on some more errors.
- Allows any language-code to be used in the working-set (because they may be extended in the standard).
- Allows picture graphics bigger than 480*480.
- Supports FixedBitmap for VTP-files.

CAN:
- Bugfix: CAN Msg Receive (Windows): CAN-HAL used other startup-time than SYSTEM-HAL.
  This did cause time-stamps of received CAN messages to appear in future when compared to time-stamps from System's getTime().
- Bugfix: Leave R-bit intact when setting the prio, also getDp() will now return 2 bits (EDP+DP) instead of only DP.
- Removed CAN-send-pause-setting. Now always bursting out all messages (because send-pause can't be set for different types of messages).
- Removed obsolete define CAN_BUS_CNT, because it was left in use only in some DEBUG parts of ESX (and A2). (Use HAL_CAN_MAX_BUS_NR instead!)

Data Link:
- Allowing TP/ETP to run in parallel now, because this is needed in Server-side implementations.
- Forbid TP/ETP (MultiReceive_c/MultiSend_c) to be used in the application, because it's too low-level for the application. (Removed iMultiSend_c)

Network Management:
- Bugfix: Nodes were incorrectly thrown out because dest.spec. Req4AC was treated like glob. Req4AC.
- Bugfix: Address-Claim sequence (sendRequestForClaimedAddress) will not be started before the scheduler-loop anymore.
- Bugfix: React properly if AC has been stolen from known remote node (avoid that incoming and outcoming messages confuse each others).
- API extended by method iIsoItem_c::getMaster(..).
- Class IsoName_c: new value for unspecified name (all 64bits are 1s now), adapted constructor and conversions accordingly.

ProprietaryPGN:
- [Bugfix] [Part 3 PropMsg] [Send-Interval was not properly set internally]

- Calling Handler::updateTimePeriod only worked properly from Handler::timeEvent
- Now it also works when being called Handler::updateSchedulerInformation,
  it retriggers instead of setTimePeriod.
- Handler::sendDate will now only send the data, not do anymore rescheduling.

Logalizer:
- Added new CAN-Format JRF.

Platforms:
- PC
  - Debug Output cleaned up.
  - Increased Number of available CAN-Channels to 32.
  - Simulating Sensor HAL: Added frequency to ditigal simulation-files
- ESX
  - Bugfix: Analog-Current-Measurement fixed, had wrong channel mapping (Didn't ever work!).
  - Bugfix: Wrong channel mapping was used (Digital instead of Analog), although Current measurement works on Analog inputs just as Voltage measurement.

update_makefile.sh:
- Bugfix: File collecting for Sensor-part was missing an "-o" in the find statement - Effect was that project couldn't be linked.
- Bugfix: USE_RS232 to be set automatically when PRJ_RS232 is set.
- Added generation of IAR embedded Workbench IDE file and dependent files.
- SYSTEM_XYZ define will not be generated by update_makefile anymore (removed USE_SYSTEM_DEFINE). It is now defined by the according hal/<platform>/config.h
- Allow proprietary HALs to be used, even from an outside directory. Added USE_HAL_PATH for that reason.
- From now on, HAL_PATH_ISOAGLIB_<SYSTEM/CAN/EEPROM> and HAL_PATH_SUPPLEMENTARY_<RS232/ACTOR/SENSOR/DATASTREAMS> will be written to the config_<project>.h file (instead of the SYSTEM_XYZ define)
- Even less auto-feature adjusting (with Warning) now. Will "exit 2" with an Error instead.
- Files in the "hal/" directories are now named hal_<module>.h to differentiate them from the hal/<target>/<module>/<module>.h files.
- typedef.h moved into hal/ directory with the new name hal_typedef.h
- Interface-Filelist will now simply collect all ".h" headers (from the "hal" dirs) from the general filelist. (Some few too much headers wouldn't mind)
- Generated Makefile is now again the Makefile itself, not a linking shortcut.
- Now auto-checking for the available HAL-modules (bail out if the mandatory ones are not available, and detect which ones of the supplementaries are available)
- Not anymore generating the "config_header__"-files.
- Added Option for debug-definition group, mostly used for autobuild-system.
- Generates files (CMakeLists.txt) to be used by CMake to build for Linux or Win32.
- Maps USE_MUTUAL_EXCLUSION option properly to source file list.
- Now C-files can be built just as well as C++ files.

Tutorial:
- Added ESX/C2C/ESXµ conf_files for ready-to-go projects.

CAN-Server/Devices:
- Bugfix: CAN-Server-Socket now properly closes handles on releaseClient.
- Added new device driver LAWICEL CANUSB [Windows] for CAN-Server.
- Removed hard-coded restriction to 4 channels, now more channels are possible.
- Added daemonize option "--daemonize" for linux version. The interactive flag is turned off with this option. 

HAL:
- Restructuring: HAL now included by one path per module, not via SYSTEM_XYZ define anymore
- Replaced #ifdef/#include-chains by a generic expression using HAL_SUBDIR, so a new HAL doesn't need "yet another entry in the include-#ifdef-chain".
- Removed "#ifndef STL_NAMESPACE   #define STL_NAMESPACE std   #endif" from config.h files because that's really the job of compiler_adaptation.h
- RS232-over-CAN:
 - rs232_over_can module renamed to standard module-naming (rs232.h) and placed in its own directory.
 - PRJ_RS232_OVER_CAN does not implicitly enable PRJ_RS232. (conf_template comment adapted)
 - USE_RS232_OVER_CAN (from generated config_<project>.h) removed, not needed anymore with the new mechanism.
- IsoAgLib configuration (include-files):
 - Reordered/cleaned up structure of include-dependencies of the files like "isoaglib_config.h/compiler_adaptation.h/hal_config.h/config.h:
 - Only "isoaglib_config.h" should be included, hal_config.h and compiler_adaptation.h needn't be included directly.
- HALs for EES, AMS5, A2, PM167, IMI and Mitron167 have been removed.

RS232:
- Allowing bitrates up to 115200 bit/s now.
- Added RS232 channel number -> Adapted conf_template.

TC-Client:
- Adapted message-parsing from DIS/FDIS to IS.

FS-Client:
- Bugfix: Fixed memory-leaks, hangups and slow TP-reception. Overall structural cleanup and enhancements.
- Bugfix: Fixed counter overrun; fixed path length encoding for delete command; removed DIS support and cleaned up.
- Bugfix: setFileAttributes response is detected correctly.
- Change: Now also detect single-volume systems (that don't have a volume listing).

GPS:
- Bugfix: Fixed COG_SOG_RAPID_UPDATE message's length. (Wasn't always sent out with a DLC of 8 - depended on the CAN-packet before)
- TimePosGps_c: Added Message-EventHandler and estimated time for Rapid Updates
- Corrected priority for NMEA_GPS_POSITION_DATA_PGN

Tractor:
- Don't NACK if tractor data is requested.
- ISO-NAMEs preferred to source addresses.
- Send and store language PGN.
- API can now set and send engine speed.
- API method processMsg indicates properly if a message has been processed.
- Removed one overall VT-language in favor of
  * future compatibility (there may be multiple VTs)
  * separating VT-Client functionality from Tractor-functionality.


\subsection Change_Q 2.1.2 to 2.2.0
 Repository restructuring:
 - All tools (including can_server) can now be found in the "tools" directory. Added the logalizer (can-log analyzer) tool.

 - Removed "library/simulated_io"
 - Removed all svn:externals, no more user-authentication-checkout-problems:
   - Complete Tractor Data and Proprietary PGN handling now available to the public.
   - All commercial_BIOS externals removed. If you need to build for an embedded target,
     copy the BIOS files into the commercial_BIOS folder on your own, request access to the BIOS-repository at OSB's subversion-server
     or change the BIOS path in your conf_<projectname> file to the path where you have the BIOS already installed.
 - Restructured doc/html: Now there's an API and an ALL documentation
 - Cleanup of root and admin directory

 Tutorial:
 - Added new Tutorial Network ECU Display with ecu_main (including main-loop) and its three components.

 - Added sendChangeActiveMaskCommand to iVtClientservercommunication
 - First simple support for WS slaves added.
 - Fixed signature of iVtObjectStringVariable_c::setValueCopy(char*..)
 - Allow unscaled pool upload via PROPRIETARY_NO_POOL_SCALING define
 
 TC-Client / ProcessData:

 - Allow proprietary DevPropertyHandler
 - Fixed timing on TC-Client alive if the minimum time-dist is >2sec.

 vt2iso:
 - Added SilentMode, Object-IDs/KeyCodes are being grouped into namespace now, too - Generated DEFINEs changed to static const unsigned int.
 - Added -a / -a=abc parameter: Now using ProjectName from VTP for filename per default, if not overridden using -a/-a=abc
 - Added -x=prefix parameter: Generated language-objects can now get a prefix. iVtObjectX_1 => iVtObjectX_prefix1

 update_makefile.sh
 - Removed Dev-C++ Support as Dev-C++ is a discontinued product. Focussing on Visual Studio Project-file generation instead.
 - Introduced "conf_template" as template for own project configurations. Originating from former examples' conf-files, but cleaned up / restructured.
 - Makefiles will no more automatically build a can_server-binary. The can_server-binary is available prebuilt in different
   flavors in the "bin" folder - thus removed USE_CAN_DEVICE_FOR_SERVER.
 - Project-defines with NAME=VALUE now properly generated into config_xy.h, too. (Gave warnings before)
 - Removed unit-test generation and outputting help if run without parameters
 - Added "conf_template" as basis to use for own projects.
 - Removed creation (and usage in isoaglib_config.h) of "version.h", which actually should be an application issue rather than an ISOAgLib issue.
 - Add new platform P1MC and CCS project handling
 - Improved generation speed.
 - New options --report and --report=REPORT_FILE. Separate reports from standard output in case the user wants this.
 - Change: Removed ISO_TERMINAL_SERVER support in update_makefile.sh - Use PRJ_MULTIPACKET and USE_WORKING_SET instead.

 - Fixed problem in Tasking generation when multiple pathes are used. Now using semicolon in include path rather than comma
 - Fixed problem in gathering files given by APP_SRC_EXCLUDE

 General Enhancements:
 - Adding new function to determine how many devices on the bus have a certain deviceclass and function.
 - Added the HALSimulator_c class to allow the application layer to handle HAL functions or print CAN communication.
 - Interface "iSchedulerTask_c" enhanced for setting the timePeriod and earlier/latest interval.
 - FastPacket now available in iMultiSend_c
 - Optimization: IsoMonitor_c: Remove obsolete/unnecessary std::vector.sort()
 - Adapt IsoAgLib for target without 8 bit char type (Add new NO_8BIT_CHAR_TYPE define for target that do not have 8 bit char type)
 - Added subset of Boost C++ libraries. Improved README files. Listed where libraries are used within IsoAgLib.
 - Addition of EES HAL
 - PC-HAL: Allow FLOAT_WORD_ORDER to be officially set with global DEFINEs

 General Fixes:
 - TimePosGps_c: Fixed crash when calling localHour() at a very early stage (getTime() == 0) under Windows
 - TimePosGps_c: Added missing Long-modifier for calculations like 60*60*24, did overrun on 16bit systems.
 - TimePosGps_c: Was not properly handling different senders for Trac/GPS
 - CAN-HAL: Standard Identifier CAN-messages weren't handled properly
 - CAN-HAL PC: Fixed out of bounds array access
 - CanIo_c: Change, so that next call continues search in canMsg2FilterBox.
 - MultiSend: Fixing CTS-request while sending burst:
   - MultiSend cleaned up. TP/ETP are now handled more similar.
   - CTS while burst-sending is now handled correctly, too.
   - CTS can retrieve any position in Buffer
   - CTS can retrieve start or in middle of last burst when using MultiSendStreamer
   - Request-check now enhanced. Not only position is checked to be in-range, but also the length is considered now (can we supply all the queried data?)
 - Functionality-Fix: Address-Claiming: Removed the 2500ms wait on AddressClaiming when no other item online to act normal with 1250ms.
 - AddressClaim: Now correctly handling AddressStealing in the 250ms-phase
 - Ident_c::masked def.param: Corrected wrong default parameter
 - Windows RS232-HAL: Fixed first instance 0 to be COM1 instead of COM0
 - Using consequently COMx instead of //./COMx. Both should work of course.
 - PC-EEPROM: Cleaned up DEBUG-statements and Code
 - CAN-Reception Overflow with default value: Default CAN-Receive buffer increased from 16 to 256 messages
   (Caused problems when just too many messages were on the bus - in that example
   56 address-claim messages were received, but the buffer of 16 was just too small.)
 - PC Sensor HAL: If simulated sensor-input-file was missing, it crashed
 - ECU didn't come up at all if secondly addressclaim-request was on the bus
 - Logalizer Output on Win32: Timestamp output is fixed now, using correct lli instead of Li
 - TP/ETP-Sending: Faster Cleanup of SendStream / Forbid ConnAbort on Finished Streams
 - iGenericData: Add default member in c'tors
 - Forbid copy construction of ProprietaryMessageClient_c
 - API-Fix in iMultiReceive_c: Added some missing 'MultiReceive_c::' qualifiers (resulted in self-calling endless-loop)
 - API-Enhancement in MultiReceive_c: Added methods to configure MultiReceive-timings: MultiReceive_c::setCtsDelays & MultiReceive_c::setExperimentalTimings
 - API-Change in iIsoName_c/IsoName_c: Changed behavior of default constructor iIsoName_c()/IsoName_c()
 - IsoMonitor: deleteIsoMember for Local Network Nodes ((i)IdentItem_c) did not take the cached active local item into account,
   hence it was dangling to some old memory and caused strange behavior
 - Proprietary-Message-Handling: Fixed registering with a NULL IdentItem

 ...and of course several warning-cleanups as found with newer compilers and lint...

   (All given IDs are scanned in a first pass, so they are skipped in auto-numbering)
 - You should now be able to call vt2iso also from an other directory than the one where there .vtp file resides.

 - MeasureProgBase_c: Fix that the correct SA is used in all commands which follow immediately init()
   (and not only commands after addSubProg() is called) (r3825)
 - Fix in FilterBox_c: bool was used for the return type of fifo_useMsgObjGet instead of int32_t. (r3828)
 - Process_c: Crashed (at least) in Windows when unregisterRemoteProcessData set

	- old class Base_c is subdivided into smaller classes, so that a project can better select the wanted information types.
		This allows also the better maintenance of anonymous accessible parts (most of the features existing in pre-1.2.0 release)
		and special extansions, that is only possible by personal access. Please contact  <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a>
		to gain access to the extension parts.

\subsection Change_I 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

	- now using specific LAST CAN MESSAGE OBJECT of CAN controllers to store CAN messages
		during CAN reconfiguration process for later process ( avoid loss of messages )<br>
		this is important to receive the very early triggered <b>ISO 11783</b> command <b>Request for Claimed Addresses</b>
	- the script update_makefile.sh was extended to create also Microsoft Visual Studio VC++ version 6.0 DSP files;
		This needs the installation of STLport if VC6 is used, see \ref Vc6StlPort for more information.
	- provided automatic CAN CARD HW selection for Vector-Informatik CAN CARDs so that:
		- either all CAN channels of real CAN cards can be counted
		- or just the CAN channels of the special virtual CAN device can be counted ( if no real CAN card is connected )
	- add driver for <b>Sontheim CAN cards</b> ( tested only with CANLPT, but in theory designed according general API documentation, as all card
		differences are handled by the driver, <b>extract the files from the Sontheim API ZIP in the directory <i>C:\\Development\\Sontheim</i> if you want to
		use the tutorial project files without changes</b> )
	- adapted the check for new messages in Win32 CAN cards to RTE style
	- added basic language handling and AUX functions handling into ISO Terminal
	- added <b>ISO 11783 Virtual Terminal</b> connection management, so that the pool is automatically
		reloaded on reconnection ( changed terminal properties are regarded )
	- done several cleanups and additions to <b>ISO 11783 Virtual Terminal</b>
	- enhance documentation for feature setup files for individual projects and reorganize the existing files, to make them easier to understand
	- enable HTTPS access to the subversion repository, as some proxies might hinder WebDAV access, which is needed by Subversion/Apache2<br>
		so please try HTTPS access in case you have problems with accessing the repository, before you contact <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a>
	- some cleanup of workarounds which are needed due to Tasking compiler faults - the STL of versions up to 7.56 have wrong includes
		( see file "include.cpp/algorithm" which includes "include.cpp/stl_algobase.h" which includes "string.h" into global namespace;
		  a C++ system header shall include C-Library functions into the "std::" namespace -> it should include <tt>\<cstring\></tt> instead;
			other compilers do this correct )
	- introduce config setting for project config to select HEAP allocation strategy:
		- either allocate chunks of items ( for Tasking: 40 items per chunk ) to avoid HEAP defragmentation and to avoid memory allocation runtime as long as no new chunk is
			needed, which doesn't happen for most use cases, as the chunk size is pretty big in relation to the awaited numbers of mostly smaller than 10 items
		- or directly call malloc on each item creation, which causes greater overhead per item ( linkage of all malloced blocks in HEAP, whereas the chunks have a
			pretty efficient organization structure ) and which can cause longer malloc execution time on each item creation ( can be important, if large amount
			of monitor list entries, several measurement programs, setpoints occure, or if CAN filter setting must be reconfigured due to configuration change )
		- <b>PREFER CHUNK ALLOCATION AS LONG AS HEAP OVERHEAD IS ACCEPTIBLE, USE OTHER METHOD ONLY FOR RESTRICTED HEAP MEM CONDITIONS</b>
	- avoid allocation of HEAP for elements of temporal IsoAgLib::ManageMeasureProgLocal_c instances ( create default IsoAgLib::MeasureProgLocal_c instances on first real access )
	- optimize HEAP memory item size debug messages, so that real HEAP usage is reflected ( including overhead due to memory block linking in HEAP )<br>
			Thanks to the help of Tasking support ( information on simple integration of _malloc.c into EDE projects )
	- change <b>update_makefile.sh</b> shell script to avoid calls to <b>perl</b> functions, as these are only part of standard LINUX systems, and are <b>not</b>
		part of <b>MSYS</b> system ; additionally replace UNIX style directory seperation from slash to backslash for Win32 compilers and use Windows stly newline
	- change device types and CAN channels of tutorial examples, so that e.g. 1_0_ReadIso.cpp and 1_2_WriteIso.cpp can interact ( <b>a)</b> different device types
		for both ECUs and <b>b)</b> different CAN channels so that two channels of one PC CAN card can be connected )
	- unify number intervals of CAN HAL for BUS and MsgObj numbers to start with <b>0</b> for each type of HAL ( avoid HAL dependent offset constants ).
	- change default path for Win32 CAN card manufacturer driver library files ( API DLLs and Headers ) to <i>C:\\Development</i> so that all users can install their
		driver files to the corresponding location, if they want to avoid changing all default VC++ project files ( if pathes like <i>C:\\Development\\CANLIB</i> are still
		not acceptable, update_makefile.sh can be used to create VC++ DSP files based on adapted conf_x_y project feature setup files )
	- fix bug in handling of counter input, which prevented ESX BIOS counting functions from correct work ( these functions work only if now application IRQ handler is specified )
	- fix bug in handling of PWM output diagnose ( the state detection didn't work right ) and move this diagnose function in new
		ESX HAL file actor_target_extensions.cpp
	- add note on selection of right Vector-Informatik CAN card driver ( the "XL Driver Library" is not coupled to the "XL" CAN cards;
		you can use a XL CAN card with the CANLIB driver API also - this is the case for all users the maintainers know to date --> vector_canlib is
		the right selection in the conf_foo feature setup files )

\subsection Change_H 1.0.0rc5 to 1.0.0

	- implemented all virtual terminal object types, which are defined in ISO 11783 ( thanks to Brad Cox )
	- implemented simple access function for easy change control of Vt-Object attributes like colour

\subsection Change_G 1.0.0rc4 to 1.0.0rc5

	- added trigger request for claimed address as soon as local Ident is initialized as ISO 11783
		( avoid <DeviceType, DeviceTypeInst> clash in IsoAgLib::IsoMonitor_c )
	- implemented GPS decoding for ISO 11783 based on open accessible sources ( thanks to google )
		( please test and send changes, in case a reference system reveals wrong decoding;
			decoding of Longituge and Latitude are most probably correct, others?? )
			- CAN ID 0x00FFF3LU with GPS_STATE_PGN -> probably the GPS mode is in BYTE1???
			- CAN ID 0x00FEF3LU with GPS_LATITUDE_LONGITUDE_PGN -> a google'd example shows positioning and unit of latitude and longitude
			- CAN ID 0x00FEE8LU with GPS_SPEED_HEADING_ALTITUDE_PGN -> probably last 4 Bytes contain altitude
	- extended definition possibilities for application sources in project building script <b>update_makefile.sh</b>
	- fixed bug in vt2iso.cpp which prevented it creating bitmap arrays for the 480 resolution
	- fixed bug in FreeImage library handling, which places Y scanlines upsidedown in relation to
		"usual" graphic algorithms -> thus the bitmaps were flipped vertically

\subsection Change_F 1.0.0rc3 to 1.0.0rc4

	- reordered main documentation blocks
	- changed device type of virtual terminal example to tillage so that
		conflicts with the tractor instance of CANoe are avoided

\subsection Change_E 1.0.0rc2 to 1.0.0rc3

	- added support for Vector Informatik CAN driver libraries <b>CANLIB</b> and <b>XL Driver Library</b>
		( integrate it in the project generation script, so that a Dev-C++ project can be simply created )
	- made management of Master Working Set state of a local IsoAgLib::IdentItem_c ( representing of local ISO 11783
		node in the library ) more robust against SA and Device Type conflicts
	- enhanced some documentation
	- fixed some small problems in interaction with CANoe virtual terminal ( thanks to Brad Cox )

\subsection Change_D 1.0.0rc1 to 1.0.0rc2

	- added several features to the project generation script to create project
		files for the Open Source Win32 IDE "Dev-C++" and for the Tasking EDE
	- enhanced documentation ( esp. Getting Started Guide, extended HTML links in examples
		to demonstrated features )
	- renamed all usages of "Announce" to the more standard conformant "Address Claim" and
		change "DPlus" to "CanEn" to make ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> terms easier to understand
	- enhanced overall integration into Win32 ( thanks to the help of Brad Cox )
	- integrated the virtual terminal mask handling tool <b>vt2iso</b> to Win32 build
		with Dev-C++ ( added alternative image manipulation library usage for <b>Free Image</b> )

\subsection Change_C 0.2.1 to 1.0.0rc1

	- reorganization of source files
	- ISO 11783 at larger extend:
	    - working set messages
			- virtual terminal
			- process data state of Spring 2003
			- some bugs of first ISO approach fixed
	- extended documentation with several examples and diagrams
	- global access to central service classes to avoid complicated access through several steps
	- reduced usage of heap memory
	- reorganized error handling
	- better integration in time schedule of application, as main function for periodic actions of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> allows
	    now to define a final time of return, where ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> returns at latest to the application
	- smarter structure of namespaces
	- several variants of process data, to restrict resource usage to needed level by selection of process data
	    type, which provides exactly the needed features
	- simple integration of process data and local identity variables within the program scope -> better control of memory and activation

\subsection Change_B 0.2.0 to 0.2.1

	- corrected some small errors of synchronisation between working 0.1.0 tree and the new 0.2.0
	- fixed bug in process data list management

\subsection Change_A 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

	- optional basic set of <b>ISO 11783</b> features
	- possibility of baud rate auto sensing on power up and on BUS OFF errors (with configurable wait time).
	- partitioning of sources in different packages. A base package contains system management, base tractor information
			and CAN driver. All optional modules like process data or EEPROM driver can now
			be downloaded as separate source archives.
	- ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> specific CAN driver module to ease hardware adaptation
	- collection of all files which must be edited for hardware adaptation to one directory and reduction of the amount
			of affected files
