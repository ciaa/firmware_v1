# This file servers as a template to use when starting a new IsoAgLib project
# Make a copy of this file and adapt it to your needs: Set mandatory values
# and activate some commented-out options (if needed)...
#
# The steps are:
#  [0. On Windows, have MSYS/MinGW installed.]
#   1. Copy conf_template -> conf_<PROJECTNAME>
#   2. Setup your wanted IsoAgLib configuration here
#   3. Create your application files (these will be collected by conf2build.sh)
#   4. Run "<PATH_TO_bin>/conf2build.sh conf_<PROJECTNAME>"
#       in your native Linux or MSYS/MinGW Windows shell to get the generated project

# NOTE: If building IsoAgLib purely as a library

### General Setup
#################

# Specify if Part 3 - Data Link Layer: Basic ISOBUS Protocol is enabled.
PRJ_ISO11783=1

# Specify if Part 3 - Proprietary Messages (via Proprietary PGNs) is enabled.
# PRJ_PROPRIETARY_PGN_INTERFACE=1

# Note: This is currently always added to IsoAgLib as it is mandatory now.

# Specify if Part 13 - FS-Client support is enabled.
# PRJ_ISO_FILESERVER_CLIENT=1

# Specify if Part 7 - all BASE data are selected
# if only special BASE data should be used select one or more of the following parts
# PRJ_BASE=1

# only incorporate parts from BASE that provide tractor hitch and RPM information
# PRJ_TRACTOR_GENERAL=1

# only incorporate parts from BASE that provide tractor moving (distance, speed, direction, ...) information
# the following project setting includes only measurement of tractor data.
# i.e. NO SETTING OF COMMANDS
# PRJ_TRACTOR_MOVE=1

# additionally integrate sending of tractor move commands

# Specify if Part 7 - ISB support is enabled.
# PRJ_ISB_CLIENT=1

### Special Setup / Customization / Optimization
##############################################

# Specify Part 3 - Data Link Layer: Transport Protocol stream receive strategy:
# chunk (default): use list of chunks where each receive burst is stored in one chunk -> useful when on-the-fly parsing is used
#                  and thereby less HEAP has to be used for storage
#                  -> let PRJ_MULTIPACKET_STREAM_CHUNK stay commented out, or set to 1
# linear         : if only final parsing is used, then chunk handling can't reduce HEAP usage, so that simpler linear buffer can be used
#                  -> set  PRJ_MULTIPACKET_STREAM_CHUNK to 0
# PRJ_MULTIPACKET_STREAM_CHUNK=1

# Specify if Part 6 - VT-Client should be size optimized
#                     (leaves out unneeded object-type implementations)
# The following defines can be set to "<PATH>/<OBJECTPOOLPROJECT_NAME>-objectselection.inc"
# files created by vt2iso to specify which objects are NOT part of the object pool(s)
# and thus need not be included in IsoAgLib's VT-Client module.
# PRJ_ISO_TERMINAL_OBJECT_SELECTION1="MaskDefinition/simpleVTIsoPool-objectselection.inc"

# PRJ_ISO_TERMINAL_OBJECT_SELECTION4="<ANOTHER_POOL>-objectselection.inc"


# ###############################################################
# Optional Driver Selection
# ###############################################################

# select if support for EEPROM access should be enabled.
# PRJ_EEPROM=1

# Select wanted type of EEPROM driver connection:
# embedded targets: "sys"
# pc targets: "simulating" | "hal_simulator"
# USE_EEPROM_DRIVER="simulating"

# select if the datastreams from HAL for file input and output shall be used
# PRJ_DATASTREAMS=1

# select iRS232IO_c for RS232 output which can be used like the
# standard C++ iostreams
# PRJ_RS232=1

# Define the amount of available RS232 channels at the ECU
# ( default 1 )
# RS232_CHANNEL_CNT=1

# Define the amount of RS232 instances to support
# ( all values lower than 1 are overwritten by default 1 )
# This is especially important if your ECU has more than one RS232 channel
# and you intend to use more than one RS232 channel at the same time.
# RS232_INSTANCE_CNT=1

# Select wanted type of RS232 driver connection:
# embedded targets: "sys"
# pc_win32 targets: "sys" | "simulating" | "hal_simulator"
# pc_linux targets: "sys" | "simulating" | "hal_simulator" | "rte"
# USE_RS232_DRIVER="simulating"

# select special RS232 virtual driver HAL for RS232_over_CAN
# PRJ_RS232_OVER_CAN=1

# Select wanted type of INPUTS/OUTPUTS driver connection:
# embedded targets: "sys"
# pc targets: "simulating" | "hal_simulator"
# USE_INPUTS_DRIVER="simulating"
# USE_OUTPUTS_DRIVER="simulating"

# select iDigitalO_c ( one instance/variable of this class per channel )
# for digital On/Off input
# ( provides automatic range check which uses diagnose function of HAL
#  - BIOS/OS - to check if current is in allowed interval );
# use iActorO_c for global access to all active iDigitalO_c instances
# PRJ_INPUTS_DIGITAL=1

# select iAnalogI_c for analog ( current or voltage ) sensor input.
# or iAnalogIRangeCheck_c with enhanced automatic range check
# PRJ_INPUTS_ANALOG=1

# select iCounterI_c for counter input.
# the existing HAL implementations ( e.g. for ESX ) extend the BIOS/OS
# function, as a IsoAgLib specific event counting for very low
# event repetition rates is provided - the BIOS version is only
# designed for typical RPM values
# PRJ_INPUTS_COUNTER=1

# select if the digital output driver shall be integrated into the project.
# you can then use the HAL of IsoAgLib to realize a mostly hardware independend
# access on PWM output. This is completely independent from communication tasks.
# PRJ_OUTPUTS=1
