@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example configures SGPIO to generate high speed patterns using DMA.
		
	Process:
		The M4 comes up first to configure the clock as well as the SGPIO and starts M0
		- M0 controls SGPIO0 to SPGIO15 to output high frequency patterns
		- M0 also commands the DMA to transfer pattern data from memory to SGPIO slices
		
		
@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files  
	
	main_M4.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Hitex LPC4300 Board as well as Keil MCB4300

		

@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
