@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to implement an simple web application 
	Process:
		This tiny web server was taken from the 'Design & Elektronik'
		extra issue 'Embedded Internet'. It can be downloaded from the 
		following web site: www.elektroniknet.de/extraheft. 

		This software was adapted to work with a LPC18xx Validation board and 
		the Keil RV ARM C-Compiler with as few modifications as possible. 

		Note that modifications are not optimal, because ARM is a 32-bit 
		machine while the original software was written for 16-bit cpu.

		The web page shows the values of two analog inputs (AN0 and AN1).
		This tiny webserver needs very little resources and therefore has
		some restrictions:
		- only one active TCP session at any one time
		- no support for fragmented IP datagrams
		- no buffer for TCP datagrams received in wrong order
		- only one web page. No GIF/JPG graphics possible.

		The IP address can be modified in the module tcpip.h to
		fit into your existing LAN (see MYIP_x). 
		The default IP address is: 192.168.0.100

		MAC address can be changed from emac.h file
		IP Address can be changed from tcpip.h file

		Note: check correct settings for jumpers according the board's manual

		Please order the extra issue 'Embedded Internet' of the 
		'Design & Elektronik' magazine for a technical description.
		It is only available in German language.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:	
		This example is tested on:
			Hitex LPC4350EVA-A4-2 Board
		Jumper Settings:
			- SV6: Close all
			- SV3: Close all
	Running mode:
		On Keil
			Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
						All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into Internal SRAM through a
						debugger tool before running
			Hitex Flash mode: 	All files must be built to .hex file before burn into flash
				+ This example can be run on external flash:
					* SST39X320X:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						
					SPIFI 64MB Debug mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 
					SPIFI 128MB mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOADs 						

		On IAR
			Built the project (F7)
			Internal SRAM mode: This example can run on Internal SRAM.
				Download and debug (CTRL + D)
				Seclect Device Cortex M4 (if any)
			Hitex Flash mode: This example can run on 
				Hitex Flash (SST39X320X external parallel flash):
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 128MB mode:
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 64MB Debug mode:
					Download and debug (CTRL + D)
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Use CrossOver cable to connect from your PC to ETH port on eval board
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Re-config IP address on PC:
					+ IP address: 192.168.0.x (x != 100)
					+ Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
		- Step 5: Run Debug the board
		- Step 6: Open command prompt window, execute 'ping 192.168.0.100' command then wait until it replies
		- Step 7: Open web browser, access to address "http://192.168.0.100" to display the content
		           of webserver. Turn potentiometer and see the update ADC value on this web
		           		
		(Pls reference "LPC43xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > EMAC > Easy_Web"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil		
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
